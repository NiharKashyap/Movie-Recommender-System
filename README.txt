This repo contains the work I did on a recommendation system while learning Data Science.

There are two ipynb files having two seperate approaches:

1. Movie_recommender_normal: This approach uses cosine similarity to recommend movies. Though reccommendations are satisfactory the size of the similarity matrix is too large (about 3.84 GB) to be commercially feasible

2. Movie_recommenderDL.ipynb: This approach uses Deep Learning with Matrix Factorization to recommend movies. Still working on it.


At a later stage I have plans to convert it into a web app
